## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### 1. **User Role Permissions**

- **Solution**: Upgraded user role to `author` 
- **Result**: ✅ Can now access `/dashboard/posts/new`

### 2. **Content Format Handling**
- **Problem**: Rich text editor returned HTML but database expected JSON
- **Solution**: Updated PostEditor to properly handle HTML content storage
- **Result**: ✅ Rich text content saves and displays correctly

### 3. **Button Functionality**
- **Problem**: Save Draft and Publish buttons had incorrect disable conditions
- **Solution**: Fixed validation logic for content and title
- **Result**: ✅ Both buttons work correctly

### 4. **Reading Time Calculation**
- **Problem**: Reading time calculation didn't handle HTML content properly
- **Solution**: Updated algorithm to strip HTML tags before word counting
- **Result**: ✅ Accurate reading time calculation

### 5. **Database Operations**
- **Problem**: Content conversion issues between frontend and database
- **Solution**: Streamlined content handling in usePosts hook
- **Result**: ✅ Seamless post creation, updating, and publishing
