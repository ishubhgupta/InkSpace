- ✅ Supabase storage connectivity

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT PREREQUISITES

**Before full testing, apply the RLS fix:**

```sql
-- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- File: supabase/migrations/008_fix_rls_infinite_recursion.sql
```

This fixes infinite recursion in RLS policies that currently prevents dashboard access.

### 🎯 READY FOR USE

1. **Seamless uploads** with automatic compression
2. **Clear feedback** on compression results
3. **Smart restrictions** to maintain quality and performance
4. **Professional UI** with progress indicators and helpful information
5. **Reliable storage** with proper organization and metadata

### 📋 TESTING CHECKLIST

To verify functionality:

- [ ] Apply RLS fix migration
- [ ] Upload large profile image (>50KB)
- [ ] Upload blog images in post editor
- [ ] Try uploading 3rd image to blog (should be blocked)
